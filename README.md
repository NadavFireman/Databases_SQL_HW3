# Databases (SQL): Home Assignment 3 - Advanced Querying

This repository contains the solution for the third and final home assignment in the Databases course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The assignment focuses on advanced, practical SQL usage, including complex filtering, temporal querying (date functions), multi-way JOINs, and aggregation across an operational database structure.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Advanced Multi-Table JOINs:** Utilizing complex INNER and OUTER JOINs (Left/Right Join) to combine data from four or more related tables (Suppliers, Items, Orders, etc.).
* **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Practical use of DDL commands (e.g., CREATE TABLE) to define the database schema and enforce relational constraints.
* **Complex Filtering and Aggregation:** Implementing challenging WHERE and HAVING clauses, including date-based filtering and statistical aggregation (AVG, COUNT, SUM) across grouped data.
* **Problem Solving with Sub-queries:** Employing nested queries (Sub-queries) in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses to achieve intricate query requirements.
